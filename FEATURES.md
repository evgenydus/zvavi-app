## Region Picker

The homepage shows an interactive map of all active forecast regions, each polygon colored by its current overall hazard level. Tapping a region opens a summary popup with the hazard icon, level, and a link to the region page. The selected region is remembered between visits.

## Avalanche Forecasts

Daily professional forecasts for each active region in the Georgian backcountry. Each forecast includes:

- **Danger levels** for multiple elevation zones (sub-alpine, alpine, high-alpine) on the standard 1–5 European scale
- **Avalanche problem breakdown** — up to 9 problem types (storm slab, wind slab, persistent slab, wet slab, cornices, etc.) with affected aspects, elevation bands, likelihood, and size
- **Narratives** — weather outlook, snowpack assessment, and additional hazard notes written by certified forecasters
- **Recent avalanche history** — observed natural and human-triggered events with location, size, and date

Forecasts are authored in a draft/publish workflow, so forecasters can prepare and review before going live.

## Forecast Area Map

Interactive map showing the forecast area boundary for each region, giving users a clear spatial reference for where the forecast applies.

## Forecast Archive

## Member Verification

Each team member receives a unique QR code. Scanning it opens a verification page that confirms their current membership status, helping partners quickly authenticate credentials.

### Forecast Authoring
Forecasters can create, edit, duplicate, and publish forecasts through a structured form covering all hazard levels, problem types, and narrative fields. Drafts are invisible to the public until explicitly published.

### Recent Avalanche Catalog
Administrators can browse all recorded avalanche observations in a paginated table, filter by occurrence or creation date, and edit or delete individual records directly — without going through a forecast.

### Member Management
Administrators can manage the team roster: add members, update their status (active, inactive, pending, suspended, expired), set membership validity dates, and generate or view their verification QR codes.

### Staff Profiles
Forecasters and administrators can view and edit their own profile — including display name, a short bio, and a profile photo. The photo and name are shown in the admin panel header. When creating a forecast, the forecaster field is automatically prefilled with the logged-in user's name.

### Weather Station Management
Administrators can manage the list of mountain weather stations: add, edit, delete, and reorder them via drag-and-drop. Each station has a name in English and Georgian, an altitude, and a link to its live data feed.

### Partner Benefits Management
Administrators can manage a list of partner organizations and the exclusive discounts or perks they offer to Avalanche Georgia members. Each partner has a name, optional benefit description, logo, and website — all stored in both English and Georgian. Active partners are displayed to the public in a "Member Benefits" drawer accessible from the Join Us page and the member verification card.
